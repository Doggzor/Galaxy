### Vertical scrolling shoot 'em up style game **(UNFINISHED)**

<br>This project is used to test out different methods and some more advanced stuff.
<br>It has a select screen (*keyboard controls only*) and the first 2 waves of enemies.
<br>The code is set up in a way that new enemies and waves can be easily added to the game.
<br>**However**, it will remain an unfinished game as its purpose is to spot possible errors and difficulties
while coding this type of game basically from scratch.

***The code can be built and run through Visual Studio.***
